# Codility-Challenges-C-
My solutions to the programming challenges set by codility.com. Solutions are written in C. 
All programs pass the Codility challenges with 100% correctness and 100% performance.

Some of the solutions are fully executable C programs. 
These should be executed in the command line. In some cases extra arguments are needed.

Some of the solutions are not complete C programs and cannot be compiled. 
However, one can check these solutions are correct on the codility.com website (February 2016).
