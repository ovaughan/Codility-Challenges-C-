 % Codility.com Lesson 4, Task 2: Missing Integer %
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
 Write a function:
 
 int solution(int A[], int N);
 
 that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
 
 For example, given:
 
 A[0] = 1
 A[1] = 3
 A[2] = 6
 A[3] = 4
 A[4] = 1
 A[5] = 2
 the function should return 5.
 
 Assume that:
 
 N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
 each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
 Complexity:
 
 expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
 expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
 Elements of input arrays can be modified.
